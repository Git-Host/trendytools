                    	<li>
                        	<h3>1) Mark, thank you very much for giving us an opportunity to talk with you today. Can you please tell us briefly about your background?</h3>
                        	<p><u>Mark Said:</u> I have a MBA from De Montfort University and worked as an accountant for a number of years before setting up my first business called Houses Online. Houses Online offered free property advertising but was way before its time and failed due to lack of funding. However, one skill I managed to pick up while running the site was SEO, and I set up my first SEO business in 2000 (when Google was an up and coming search engine).</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        	<h3>2) Can you please tell us how you established Freevirtualservers.com? What was the inspiration for the idea of creating Freevirtualservers.com? </h3>
                        	<p><u>Mark Said:</u> A lot of my SEO customers were paying extortionate fees for web hosting and not getting a good service either. So I set up a reseller account to test the water, hosted a few accounts to get a feel for the market and realised there was a gap in the market for a good free web hosting service (limited only by bandwidth) and cheap hosting backed by excellent technical support. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        	<h3>3) Could you give us an overview of Freevirtualservers.com services?</h3>
                        	<p><u>Mark Said:</u> Free Virtual Servers primarily provide cheap domain name registration, affordable web hosting packages, and online storage services. Our web hosting packages are ranging from a “Free Domain Hosting” that allows you to build and publish a simple website completely free with each domain name you register; to a fully dedicated server for the ultimate hosting experience. <br>
<br>
	
In addition to those, we also offer add-on products such easy-to-use HTML5 web builder, SSL certificates, and an anti-malware software that protects your website and visitors from hackers. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        	<h3>4) Freevirtualservers.com uses TrendyTools - cPanel website builder plugin.  What are the advantages of that? Did it add value to your current offering?</h3>
                        	<p><u>Mark Said:</u> The majority of our customers have little or no knowledge of web design or programming. They want to have a beautiful and professional website without having to spend weeks to build it, or spend thousands of pounds on a professional web designer. TrendyTools web builder provide them with the ability to do just this in just minutes with no coding skills required.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        	<h3>5) From reading through your customer testimonials, I can see that they are very happy with your services and products. Can you tell us your secret for becoming so successful?</h3>
                        	<p><u>Mark Said:</u> We offer exceptional value for money packages with exceptional technical support. Even I free hosting customers get high levels of technical support with most tickets answered within 15 minutes. Also, customers like the fact we will go over and beyond.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        	<h3>6) What level of support do you provide?</h3>
                        	<p><u>Mark Said:</u> We pride ourselves in providing our customers with unparalleled technical support and customer service.  Therefore, we go above and beyond of what our competitors do by offering a 24/7/365 support through live chat and ticketing system. During peak hours, our customers can also call our technical support team for emergency issues. We endeavor to answer all support queries within 15 minutes.  
On top of this, we are also offering a premium support for our Business, VPS, and Dedicated Server hosting customers that provide them with direct telephone access to our in-house Technical Manager. 
This has become one of our signatures in the industry.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        	<h3>7) Some of the things that matter most when it comes to VPS hosting are reliability and performance.  How do you ensure the best uptime and speed to your customers?</h3>
                        	<p><u>Mark Said:</u> Uptime is achieved by using trusted hardware and data-center suppliers. We use Dell and HP servers to host our VPS's. Speed is achieved by ensuring you have enough processing power and memory to handle the virtual machines. Our new VPS platform consists of up to 16 core servers with 72GB of memory. Finally by keeping the number of VPS's per hardware node low, we ensure we don't over tax the resources and degrade performance for everyone.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        	<h3>8) In your opinion, what makes a good Virtual Private Server? It would be great if you can tell us some key points when it comes to picking up the right VPS.</h3>
                            <p><u>Mark Said:</u> 
Key points to look for in a VPS are as follows:<br>
<br>
1. Low density servers - Too many VPS accounts per machine can degrade performance. At Free Virtual Servers, we ensure a low density environment so you can take fully advantage of the powerful resources from our servers. <br><br>

2. High spec hardware - The more CPU cores and RAM available to the host server, the better it will run the VPS you just bought. Free Virtual Servers use the latest generation Dell servers to ensure high quality and reliable performance.<br><br>
3. The right virtualisation technology - Using the wrong technology can lead to performance issues. You want to look for fully virtualised solutions such as KVM, Xen, Hyper-V or VMWare. Solutions such as OpenVZ or its commercial big brother Virtuozzo are only half way houses and can't shield your VPS as effectively against other misbehaving VPS's on the same host.<br>
<br>
4. Storage - This is the biggest bottleneck for VPS performance. You want to make sure you're VPS is hosted on a RAID 10 array if using mechanical disks. RAID10 allows for maximum IOPS (disk operations per second), while protecting against disk failures. If your prospective host uses SSD's you will get even better performance.<br>
<br>
To sum up, A KVM or Xen VPS hosted on low-density RAID10/SSD servers will give you the best performance.

                        <li>
                        	<h3>9) And before we end this, how does the future look to you? In term of your own company and the hosting industry in general?</h3>
                            <p><u>Mark Said:</u>  Competition within the industry is intense with customers demanding 100% uptime. Our aim is to continue to achieve 100% uptime combined with excellent support and value added services. In 2014, we will be launching a range of high specification fully managed VPS's and cloud servers at very competitive prices. </p>

                        	<h3>7) Some of the things that matter most when it comes to VPS hosting are reliability and performance.  How do you ensure the best uptime and speed to your customers?</h3>
                        	<p><u>Mark Said:</u> Uptime is achieved by using trusted hardware and data-center suppliers. We use Dell and HP servers to host our VPS's. Speed is achieved by ensuring you have enough processing power and memory to handle the virtual machines. Our new VPS platform consists of up to 16 core servers with 72GB of memory. Finally by keeping the number of VPS's per hardware node low, we ensure we don't over tax the resources and degrade performance for everyone.</p>

                        	<h3>8) In your opinion, what makes a good Virtual Private Server? It would be great if you can tell us some key points when it comes to picking up the right VPS.</h3>
                            <p><u>Mark Said:</u> 
Key points to look for in a VPS are as follows:<br>
<br>
1. Low density servers - Too many VPS accounts per machine can degrade performance. At Free Virtual Servers, we ensure a low density environment so you can take fully advantage of the powerful resources from our servers. <br><br>

2. High spec hardware - The more CPU cores and RAM available to the host server, the better it will run the VPS you just bought. Free Virtual Servers use the latest generation Dell servers to ensure high quality and reliable performance.<br><br>
3. The right virtualisation technology - Using the wrong technology can lead to performance issues. You want to look for fully virtualised solutions such as KVM, Xen, Hyper-V or VMWare. Solutions such as OpenVZ or its commercial big brother Virtuozzo are only half way houses and can't shield your VPS as effectively against other misbehaving VPS's on the same host.<br>
<br>
4. Storage - This is the biggest bottleneck for VPS performance. You want to make sure you're VPS is hosted on a RAID 10 array if using mechanical disks. RAID10 allows for maximum IOPS (disk operations per second), while protecting against disk failures. If your prospective host uses SSD's you will get even better performance.<br>
<br>
To sum up, A KVM or Xen VPS hosted on low-density RAID10/SSD servers will give you the best performance.

                        	<h3>9) And before we end this, how does the future look to you? In term of your own company and the hosting industry in general?</h3>
                            <p><u>Mark Said:</u>  Competition within the industry is intense with customers demanding 100% uptime. Our aim is to continue to achieve 100% uptime combined with excellent support and value added services. In 2014, we will be launching a range of high specification fully managed VPS's and cloud servers at very competitive prices. </p>
